{
    "directory": "/path/to/files",
    "pattern": "*.mp3",
    "max_workers": 4,  # Adjust based on system
    "model": "mlx-community/whisper-large-v3-turbo",
    "skip_existing": true,
    "output_formats": "txt,srt"
}
```

### Performance Monitoring

```python
# Check model performance before choosing
model_info = await client.call_tool("get_model_info", {
    "model_id": "mlx-community/whisper-large-v3-turbo"
})

# Monitor system resources
perf_stats = await client.read_resource("transcription://performance")
```

### Model Caching Strategy

1. **Download large-v3-turbo first** (most commonly used)
2. **Cache medium** as backup for memory issues
3. **Keep small** for quick processing
4. **Clear unused models** periodically to save space

```python
# Pre-cache your preferred model
await client.call_tool("get_model_info", {
    "model_id": "mlx-community/whisper-large-v3-turbo"
})
```
