We have a quick time to figure out things, do your work, do the work, and then we will get back to you with an answer. By that time, we would have more time to discuss. If you agree with certain approach, if you have different perspective, we will tackle this issue. We will respect your definition, and then we will like to know how to do it. But yeah, at this stage, I would like to let us try to help you with the plan. Let us try to do everything. Because the reason you pay us is because you trust our professional experience. We will do all this work. I actually thank you for calling me. I have been waiting for this call for the artist. For you, I do trust you. Because we talk and James, my girl who is reference to you. I know you are also working with other friends. He is actually reference you. I have the trust of you. But it just sometimes, like Amanda, when she asked me questions, it is making work. I know you are professional. I know you are busy. I know you are busy. That is why for me, I am a character. I grow up in a place where it is a communist country. I will take everything responsible myself. This is my best way of doing everything. You see, I drag something on all this. I am just a very busy, miss understanding. You see me, I also like you. I am a founder. I do everything to account. I know I pay for you. I know you will do a good job. But I am just myself. This way you work with me. I think if we work this time, we are going to work together in a long time. Because this means I want to be a long time relationship. I want to find someone like you. I think I think I think I would say that usually it is a cultural thing. I don't know if you have, because it is very different from how we approach tax and how we approach taxes. Like the approach we are using as in certain communication about you. This approach we have been using for 10 years. So the pamphlet, the question, and usually in 99 for 9% of its fees, if our clients respond well, we will give them a different point.
