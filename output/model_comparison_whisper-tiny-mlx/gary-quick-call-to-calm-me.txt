[0.00s - 5.00s]: I'm trying to have an empty and sub.
[5.00s - 9.00s]: We need to do the client education for this hour for our work.
[9.00s - 13.00s]: This actually not really is a sufficient way
[13.00s - 15.00s]: and it will not help you to stop the problem.
[15.00s - 19.00s]: So what I'm talking about is, I just want to give this a performance
[19.00s - 23.00s]: where you are. We have a client to do everything.
[23.00s - 27.00s]: So we understand you have a lot of passion and that.
[27.00s - 32.00s]: We will come to you the process because the out-of-make all everyone comes here.
[32.00s - 36.00s]: They use that contract in a way to add the same passion.
[36.00s - 39.00s]: They add the out-make all it's actually.
[39.00s - 41.00s]: We know our clients want to do the same thing.
[41.00s - 43.00s]: They only get a balance.
[43.00s - 47.00s]: They want to, they want to take the track.
[47.00s - 53.00s]: They don't want to take the track that's an aggressive and they want to do the integration.
[53.00s - 56.00s]: Yeah, we don't want to spend that.
[56.00s - 62.00s]: You just want to have the client to review your things.
[62.00s - 65.00s]: Do your work. Do the work.
[65.00s - 68.00s]: And we'll get back to you with an answer.
[68.00s - 75.00s]: And then by that time, we would have more chances to discuss about if you agree with them.
[75.00s - 78.00s]: And I'm told if you have different perspectives,
[78.00s - 79.00s]: you can see that.
[79.00s - 80.00s]: Like, we're back.
[80.00s - 84.00s]: You know, the picture that we were like, you know, how we do it.
[84.00s - 90.00s]: But yeah, at this stage, I was like, then, let us give it a end.
[90.00s - 95.00s]: And then I'd like to let us try to offer something.
[95.00s - 97.00s]: Let us tell you what's my line.
[97.00s - 100.00s]: So I would like us try to do it.
[100.00s - 107.00s]: Okay, because the reason you pay us is to give you the track's out-of-personal experience, right?
[107.00s - 110.00s]: We would feel this work.
[110.00s - 111.00s]: Yeah.
[111.00s - 114.00s]: You know, I actually thank you for calling the eye.
[114.00s - 116.00s]: I did waiting for this coffee on us.
[116.00s - 121.00s]: You know, for you, I do trust you because we talk and James,
[121.00s - 125.00s]: my girl who's referred to you and I know you also working with all the friends.
[125.00s - 127.00s]: His friend actually referred to you.
[127.00s - 130.00s]: So I have the, you know, the trust you.
[130.00s - 134.00s]: But it just sometimes like the Amanda, when you should ask me questions,
[134.00s - 136.00s]: it's meant to be worth to be honest.
[136.00s - 138.00s]: You know, I know you got a professional.
[138.00s - 139.00s]: I know you got easy.
[139.00s - 140.00s]: I know you've easy.
[141.00s - 145.00s]: And that's what, you know, for me, you know, I'm kind of like, come on.
[145.00s - 149.00s]: I grow up in a place where it's communist country, right?
[149.00s - 152.00s]: So I, I would take everything responsible myself.
[152.00s - 154.00s]: This is my best way of doing everything.
[154.00s - 158.00s]: You see, like, I, I'll address something on all this because I'm just a very,
[158.00s - 160.00s]: I'm just a very, you guys.
[160.00s - 163.00s]: So be, you get miss understanding.
[163.00s - 166.00s]: So, you know, you just see me, you know, I also like you.
[166.00s - 168.00s]: I'm on a, on a power or something, you know.
[168.00s - 172.00s]: So, you know, so whatever I do, I tend to, everything to, I count here.
[172.00s - 177.00s]: I, I rather, I rather, I know this is actually, I know I pay for you at this premium rise.
[177.00s - 179.00s]: I know you, you do a good job.
[179.00s - 183.00s]: But I'm just myself, just this way and you won't with me because I think,
[183.00s - 187.00s]: if we work, except for what it is, we're going to work together in the long term,
[187.00s - 188.00s]: because this is made.
[188.00s - 189.00s]: I want to be a long term relationship.
[189.00s - 192.00s]: I want to buy someone like you to be honest.
[192.00s - 194.00s]: I want to buy someone like you because,

[464.00s - 470.50s]: I just, you know, like, because I went after I take you guys out, it's been a long story for that.
[470.50s - 481.00s]: And I know you guys are one of the top, and that's why I decided to go with you guys, I mean, you specifically, to be honest, because I talked to you as well, trust me.
[481.00s - 489.00s]: So like, when Amanda asked me questions where the way she talked, you know, I'm a detail-oriented guy, come on, I'm a fucking father, right?
[489.00s - 493.90s]: I'm a father, I mean, I have businesses, I'm at this age, you know, I do this feeling a lot,
[493.90s - 502.90s]: and it's not, it's okay, all the things, I'm not sure, I'm sure that I have limited knowledge and time, that's why I'm here with you, right?
[502.90s - 505.90s]: Because you know all this, and I love to work with you.
[505.90s - 509.90s]: I was saying, don't film like, I'm pretty sick and much emotion.
[509.90s - 521.90s]: I mean, it's just a kind of approach to jail, when there's actions or the questions, we, we ask the things questions, so they're like five countries without the science.
[521.90s - 546.90s]: So please, take over and analyze the post post, and it says you may want to different posts, like I don't know, like in a professional vaccine or out, so yeah, they're just kind of like, you're back to your biggest business and things, you think it's not for fashion or that's like, that's like, answering now, like, you know.
[546.90s - 573.90s]: I mean, if it's you, I just come from you, like, if it's like telling me, like, hey, it's not telling me, okay, so we're going to, because you, when she asked the questions, okay, so they're going to do like this, they're going to keep the 60,000, so I, to see ask my wife, okay, the one thing is, I'll ask me, okay, I was like, oh, I need more assessment from Gary, because I don't know whether it's come from her, Amanda, I was kind of like you.
[573.90s - 594.90s]: And you can ask those parents a station, right? Like, yeah, you don't need it. I think one of the problems, like, the aim that we need to be really appolarized by this, we, a professional and kind of, you know, when we have to do lots of complaints, it's both under our parents.
[594.90s - 605.90s]: So, my outplayers should not just rely on highware, but like, the whole power sponsors for us as a model of these therapists, okay?
[605.90s - 611.90s]: So, when we take those to the aim, we always want to go with them.
[611.90s - 639.90s]: So, when I told them the thing to do, if you need a representation, then you just need to respond, you can say, you know, then you explain certain things, why you make this gesture, but we are all sensitive if you're more exclamation, however, if you just require, yes, you are free, but please, you're on, you actually disagree, that's not an effective application, okay?
[639.90s - 659.90s]: So, if we get less one position of person here, because I cannot do everything, like I can, you have like, over, like, so we have centers of this problem, it's better year, and then, could I ask, that's also, that's not what they're worried too, yeah.
[659.90s - 684.90s]: So, I think I would, yeah, every one of them comes to me to confirm everything's about details, so I mean, I'm going to take it, like, a personal way or take it, but you know, if you're only a thousand people, it's a higher file of things, then we just focus on that pressure and try to figure out what to do with the opportunity.
[684.90s - 700.90s]: And then for now, like, what people want, what people want is like, I am releasing a lot of different new special, or just characterizing all of action and assets of as well as things.
[700.90s - 716.90s]: The thing is, we understand, we understand how our clients want to achieve the goal, so we are, yeah, and the things we are, the things for, just want to make sure you give us a lot of things.
[716.90s - 724.90s]: So, I definitely will give you that time, just like, tell me where, or tell me, you're my man that I like, hey, he was two days, I will answer you this.
[724.90s - 741.90s]: I mean, she was really quick, really fast, I like it, but the one thing is, I don't feel, I don't feel like, certain, or I don't feel like, free of mind, or what I mean, like, if it's you, you can't, you talk, they just look like, yeah, let me correct.
[741.90s - 751.90s]: And so, where we never have to be, this is, I'm a big bell from, I am still the last, kind of, the thing here, or I am, I'm a bit strange.
[751.90s - 780.90s]: Maybe she is real, but even I'm at the least, if it's, I'm a message, like, how I can have some time while I'm on the free path of course, and so this is something that I just want to explicitly tell you that, he would be not a way, how do you think, so I appreciate, I am just, I'm just, I'm a word, and I'm, you know, we will give you an explanation of this.
[780.90s - 810.90s]: And then you should not differentiate things. And because a lot of this question is not something we can advise with writing, and if it's out of our, for example, if you measure my R, C, N, all the, your application, so it's not something we, so I think, I can just get to you as a friend, on as a, as a,
