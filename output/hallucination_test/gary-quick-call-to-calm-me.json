  "text": " We spend a lot of time trying to help out the end.  We need to do the class education part. That's how it's hard.  But it's actually not really efficient that way and it will not help you to stop the problem.  So what I recommend is, I just want to give you a quick point and tell you,  we have a plan to do everything.  So we understand you have a lot of questions and we will help you to stop it.  because the automaker, everyone comes to us, they use us a different way to ask the same question.  But the automaker is actually, we know our clients want to mitigate a risk, they want to get a ban of food,  they want to save the tax, they don't want to pay tax as a non-repsist, and they want to pass the immigration.  yeah we all understand that and and uh you you just need to like let us uh have some time to  review your things do your work uh do the work and then we will get back to you with an answer  and then by that time uh we will have more chance to discuss about uh if you agree with certain  approach if you have different perspective we will definitely like respect your decision and then we  people who would like to know how to do it.  But yeah, at this stage, I would recommend  let us do the analyze, let us try to propose something,  let us tell you the timeline, let us try to do everything.  Okay, because the reason you pay us  is you trust our professional experience, right?  Like, we will do all this work, yeah.  You know, I actually thank you for calling though. I've been waiting for this call to be honest.  You know, for you, I do trust you because we talk and James, my girl, he reference to you and I know you also working with other friends.  His friend actually reference you. So I have the trust in you.  But it's just sometimes like Amanda when she asks me questions, it makes me worry to be honest.  You know, I know you guys are professional, I know you guys are busy, I know you're busy.  And that's why, you know, for me, you know, I'm kind of guy, come on, I grow up in a place where it's communist country, right?  So I will take everything responsible myself.  This is my best way of doing everything.  You see, like, I draft something or all this because I'm just afraid you guys are so busy, you guys miss understandings.  You know, you see me, you know, I also like you, I'm a founder, so whatever I do, I take everything into account.  I know I pay for you at this premium price, I know you will do a good job.  But I'm just myself, this way you work with me, because I think if we work successfully this time, we're going to work together in a long time because this means.  I want to be in a long time relationship, I want to find someone like you.  To be honest, I wild-wise surprised you.  I think there is...  I would say that usually it's a cultural template.  I don't know if you have...  Because it's very different in Canada, like how we approach tech and how we approach business.  Like the approach we are using, including communication from our team,  this approach we have been using for over ten years.  So yeah, then the template, then the question, and then usually in 99.9% of the case, if  our client just responds to a request, we will give them a peace of mind.  We just need some time to expect a lot of the questions that you ask.  Like, they have some wording that, for example, if you use, ensure something you want, you  guarantee something for IRCC, your immigration application.  Okay, to be really common, like no accountant or professional would send your response in writing  because those are completely outside our advisory roles.  The thing is, like, as EPA, we will be responsible for our empowerment and advice.  Just at the same time, we want to, like, you know, like, some of this, like, communication.  I believe it's just in the cultural difference, or as you are a really detail-oriented person,  which we appreciate, but at the same time, we want to do the way in Canada that is efficient to solve the problem.  Yes, I understand that you have a lot of passion, that's why I think this call is necessary.  I know that I need to give you a call and try to explain your situation.  just like, I would say it again, like, like, relax, and then let us do the work, and then  we will have the chance to discuss everything in details until the point that, oh, you feel  you are confident, and then we will send the response. Yeah, because now, like, a lot of  I would say they are paraphrased in different ways, but they are just asking the same thing.  We actually kept the votes on down in the call that we did that week.  And it's okay, it's because the knowledge part is different, right?  That's why you come to us.  us um just i would say that um don't take it as an offense but please understand that like uh  unfortunately you you have really been with the text knowledge and that's why it's the time to try  to um understand like our perspective and why we need to do this it's not because we want to just  take time and not answer your question or whatever because a lot of the time like for example i i i  give you a really good example if for example you cause the ra or you you you mentioned a whole bunch  of others like oh i'm not rested and blah blah blah and all stuff should be like completely  remove from your mind because this is just over-analyzed and being really paranoid and  and this will not help the case yes because our ultimate goal is like we we have working with you  to be friends and work out your back interest so uh we know what is the point sometimes in your  So, my idea is to get rid of those very first gestures.  Yeah, may I say something?  So, thank you for calling and trying to clarify it.  I agree, I agree.  You know, Gary, there's one thing, Gary.  So, if Amanda asked the question differently, it wouldn't trigger me.  I just, you know, like, because I went after I came to you guys, I did a lot of studies, okay?  And I know you guys are one of the tough, and that's why I decided to go with you guys, with you specifically, to be honest, because I talk to you so I trust you.  So, like, when Amanda asked me questions where the way she talked, you know, I'm a detail-oriented guy.  Come on, I'm a fucking founder, right?  I'm a founder.  I have businesses.  I'm at this age, you know, I've been experience a lot of stuff.  and it's not it's okay all the things I'm not sure I'm sure that I have unlimited  I have limited knowledge in time that's why I'm here with you right because you know all this  and I love to work with you  I would say don't like precipice too much emotion in the email it's just a standard procedure  when there's questions or those questions we ask the big question to offer like 500 to 1000 clients  So please don't take over and over analyze about those.  I understand you may want to different tone, but I don't know, in a professional setting or outsmelt,  the template, like in fact, do you think it's just certain things, you think it's not professional?  That's my concern now.  I mean if it's you, if it's come from you, if she is telling me, hey, is Gary telling me okay so we're gonna...  Because when she asks the question, okay so they're gonna do like this, they're gonna keep the 60,000, right?  So she asks my wife okay, the one thing is, or ask me okay, I was like, oh come on, I need more assessment from Gary.  Because I don't know whether it's come from her, Amanda, or it's come from you.  You can ask for clarification, right?  Like, you don't need it.  I think one of the common, like, things that we need to be really upfront with our client is  we, professional accounting, when we have lots of complaints, it goes under our perm.  So, like, our client should not just rely on my work, but, like, the whole correspondence of course,  that was part of the service okay so when we send out something we are responsible  so when i'm going to send something to you if you need clarification you just need to respond you can  say no then you explain certain things why you make this judgment we are open to give you more  explanation however if you just reply oh yes you agree but later on you actually disagree that's not  an effective communication okay so that's regardless what position the person is because i cannot do  everything like i can have like uh over like we have hundreds of this type of space every year  and then...  That's also one thing I worry too.  That's one thing I worry.  Yeah.  Everyone just come to me to confirm everything so detailed.  So I mean, please don't take it personally or take it emotionally.  If you want more details, if you want to clarify one thing,  then please just focus on that question  and try to elaborate.  And for now, what we don't want is our client raising a lot of different new questions or just paraphrasing all the questions and ask for the same thing.  The thing is we understand how our clients want to achieve the goal.  But we are in the same goal.  We just want to make sure you give us time to do our work.  I definitely will give you guys time to just tell me when.  Amanda, give us a few days, I will answer you this.  I mean she responds really quick, really fast. I like it.  But the one thing is, I don't feel like certain or I don't feel like free of mind.  You know what I mean?  Like if it's you, you call, you talk.  It's just like, yeah.  Let me straight forward.  We never ever received this type of email from Ayn in the last 10, 15 years or in her  the histories maybe she is new but even i never received this type of message  uh like like telling us the timeline or the recap of post and post so this is uh something that i  i just want to explicitly tell you that uh we will we know the ways how to do things so  So we appreciate our clients who just let us do our work.  And then we will give you an explanation of different things.  And because a lot of the questions is not something we can advise in writing,  and if it's out of our screen, for example, if you mention IRCC,  and all the PR applications.  So it's not something we provide  e-tail response to writing.  I can discuss with you as a friend or as a professional  outside of school,  but the thing is it's not something we will answer in e-tail.  Oh yeah, I mean it just tell me,  I know like you said you actually do all this immigration stuff too, the accountants CPA  of immigration, so I thought because I just want Amanda to when I recap it, I know it takes  a lot of time for me to think about all this, but I just want to make sure that because I  don't know whether it's from your team or just from my...  like  i would say that a little bit stress for yourself and also on us but sometimes not necessary because  Because we still have a lot of audit cases, no sign to do that.  It's just no offense, I'm just thinking that.  It's okay, Gary.  Hey, we are a businessman. It's okay, you throw me things.  And I'll listen, Gary.  I just wanna, you just tell Amanda that maybe it's just my style.  Just when say something, or when do things, just telling me like,  like okay this is actually make sure that this is actually she assess this and  that's actually coming from your team because I don't know like because I only  know you I don't know her profile  I have also 1,000 emails and Amanda has a couple hundred for sure.  So we are very receptive to our clients, but in a really precise way.  If you want a bit more detail on things, just do free to ask.  We are happy to elaborate on things.  Yeah, I mean that's why, you know, like, hey, I think that's a great way that you call to communicate to me.  because maybe I'm always a little different than a lot of people.  It's just my way of doing business.  Yes, yes, yes.  But I just want to introduce this in Canada.  In Canada, we want to be multicultural.  We accept different applications by us.  But when we handle this type of sense,  we need our client to follow our needs.  Yeah, I definitely.  but that tell me that the one thing that I also have a lot of clients, so I work with clients.  Different clients, they have a different way of communication, not everyone is the same.  So for sure, we are working together.  For sure, you know, like the way you call me like this, you're not streaming me like every client, right?  So we call, you're telling me this and this means like you actually take into consideration that I have a little more concern than you call,  which is a great way for you to do business and that's exactly what I'm going to do too.  It's just like sometimes I would do like because if Amanda like if she just say things like in a way that it's just you know it's not emotional but for me it trickles me like oh she don't know that.  I would say that it gets deep because he is a question right.  A lot of the time I realize that our client just gives too much information when we ask  like a 3-1 would be expound me like what do you do work on the computer.  Yeah, and actually all these other information are not helpful in the case.  We basically need to filter out like one information out of like a computer,  which is not helpful when we are really busy.  yeah um um i also want to like uh emphasize one point is like usually in similar days  for clients like this we only give them like 13 minutes  call like because you're reverted by a friend like we actually give you a lot of interest  conference already but i still understand you still have a lot of pressure and concerns  but i need to be a bit more um not straightforward about that but of your concerns is like i i  understand your ultimate goals and your concerns uh you don't need to think about that too much  for now gary if i if you said so i would love to i hate i you know if you said something i just want  to know like okay gary and the team only concede all information that's what i just want amanda to  say and if that's the case then I'm fine.  Sorry, what did you say?  I'm saying it's like because you said that right now, Hei Sang, you know I only take everything into consideration and our team too.  Because Amanda when she answered and asked me a question, I'm scared because I don't know whether it's from your team or it's from you or it's just from her.  I don't know her.  Yeah, yeah.  You just overanalyzed.  Yeah, so...  That's a hard question.  Like, in a lot of our cases, like our, especially for immigrant bias, they have no clue what they are talking sometimes.  They are not familiar with the rules.  They would tell us information that is incorrect.  And they would tell us, like, information inconsistently.  They will tell us information precisely.  So this is a specific procedure that we need to confirm.  If you're fine, if you feel like you're uncomfortable for this type of question,  you can just simply reply as well, like you're not comfortable to ask this question,  and then you can give a call and discuss that.  For this type of discussion, we think you try to award the head, but the thing is that if you really do it, it's not the goal.  Gary, if you deal with me, because later I also want to help on the corporation stuff.  If we work long term, I like this. I'm the kind of guy that I'm not getting offensive very easily.  very easy. I want you to throw at me whatever you feel like I'm not doing the right thing.  A lot of clients come to us because they like us being honest.  Let's just be honest. That's why I love to work with Hong Kong people, right? You guys are honest.  And then I do something that is kind of out of the line. You say, hey, it's a little out of the line.  It's a little out of the line. Oh, I'll hear. I'll listen. But I would love to hear. And I would  love to hear from you because I know like because I only know you right now  I don't know Amanda if like you and she hey Amanda I don't know like what a  coordinator to be honest I don't know what created the purpose of my cause  just a really stressful period a lot of the time me like I need to be honest with  you like like you know I need now have a lot of information which is not like  usually we accept from clients and then they have too much information so no offense, it's just we want to make sure our client's expectation is met  but at the same time we need to communicate our expectation. Sometimes we work with a lot of the doctors, for example, they over analyze a lot and it makes like an example of us or make it like a research paper  and then we would directly tell them no, please stop.  We are trying to get the tech from the store.  We are not trying to have a...  Hey, I'm Gary.  Gary, I'm a fucking tech guy, man.  I'm a fucking tech guy, okay?  And you know tech guy can be very detourative,  and you know it.  And I'm also a businessman like you.  But yes, you tell me, hey,  say we got it, I got it.  Hey, I trust you.  I trust you.  That's why I signed with you, right?  We got that, but now we will give you another discussion.  We will have another discussion when we finish everything and before we submit it to the staff.  That would be great, yes.  It's a standard procedure, so we wouldn't submit everything without getting your approval, so don't worry about it.  We just need some time to review and process it.  For all those questions, is there anything now you cannot answer on the checklist or whatever?  Oh, my wife actually uploads everything. I told Amanda too actually.  She only uploads it to the Google Drive so that it's easy for us to keep that inside.  And then there are a few questions she has in there, that's it.  My wife already still up. So Amanda can check that.  yeah i i would say that it's because like uh you are very proactive and intelligent in the ways that  uh it's very different uh 99 of our clients they know nothing and they need specific guidance on  everything and they need us to ask this their specific question like we we understand you're  being very proactive on everything and then and then we appreciate that and we will we try to  like a freak out how we can like do this better together so that's why I need to  get ready to call inside calm yourself down I meant that tell me I cannot come  because I don't know whether it's Gary talking  something that is not 100% sure.  A lot of their emails are actually reviewed by us.  So we don't need to worry too much about tax advisory.  When we put any tax advice in waiting,  those are reviewed by us.  So because this type of advisory is located at 1,000,  we had so many companies that they have over,  million dollars so yeah we will protect our own business  yeah please protect me Gary I really need your expertise right here I just want you to notice this our case please  and  It's actually, she is kind of, you know...  Yeah, at the same time, we, we, I think the overall  it's just  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.",

Because when she asks the question, okay so they're gonna do like this, they're gonna keep the 60,000, right?  So she asks my wife okay, the one thing is, or ask me okay, I was like, oh come on, I need more assessment from Gary.  Because I don't know whether it's come from her, Amanda, or it's come from you.  You can ask for clarification, right?  Like, you don't need it.  I think one of the common, like, things that we need to be really upfront with our client is  we, professional accounting, when we have lots of complaints, it goes under our perm.

If you want more details, if you want to clarify one thing,  then please just focus on that question  and try to elaborate.  And for now, what we don't want is our client raising a lot of different new questions or just paraphrasing all the questions and ask for the same thing.  The thing is we understand how our clients want to achieve the goal.  But we are in the same goal.  We just want to make sure you give us time to do our work.  I definitely will give you guys time to just tell me when.  Amanda, give us a few days, I will answer you this.  I mean she responds really quick, really fast. I like it.  But the one thing is, I don't feel like certain or I don't feel like free of mind.  You know what I mean?  Like if it's you, you call, you talk.  It's just like, yeah.  Let me straight forward.  We never ever received this type of email from Ayn in the last 10, 15 years or in her  the histories maybe she is new but even i never received this type of message  uh like like telling us the timeline or the recap of post and post so this is uh something that i  i just want to explicitly tell you that uh we will we know the ways how to do things so  So we appreciate our clients who just let us do our work.  And then we will give you an explanation of different things.  And because a lot of the questions is not something we can advise in writing,  and if it's out of our screen, for example, if you mention IRCC,  and all the PR applications.  So it's not something we provide  e-tail response to writing.  I can discuss with you as a friend or as a professional  outside of school,  but the thing is it's not something we will answer in e-tail.  Oh yeah, I mean it just tell me,  I know like you said you actually do all this immigration stuff too, the accountants CPA  of immigration, so I thought because I just want Amanda to when I recap it, I know it takes  a lot of time for me to think about all this, but I just want to make sure that because I  don't know whether it's from your team or just from my...  like",

It's just my way of doing business.  Yes, yes, yes.  But I just want to introduce this in Canada.  In Canada, we want to be multicultural.  We accept different applications by us.

Different clients, they have a different way of communication, not everyone is the same.  So for sure, we are working together.  For sure, you know, like the way you call me like this, you're not streaming me like every client, right?  So we call, you're telling me this and this means like you actually take into consideration that I have a little more concern than you call,  which is a great way for you to do business and that's exactly what I'm going to do too.  It's just like sometimes I would do like because if Amanda like if she just say things like in a way that it's just you know it's not emotional but for me it trickles me like oh she don't know that.  I would say that it gets deep because he is a question right.  A lot of the time I realize that our client just gives too much information when we ask  like a 3-1 would be expound me like what do you do work on the computer.  Yeah, and actually all these other information are not helpful in the case.  We basically need to filter out like one information out of like a computer,  which is not helpful when we are really busy.  yeah um um i also want to like uh emphasize one point is like usually in similar days",

You just overanalyzed.  Yeah, so...  That's a hard question.  Like, in a lot of our cases, like our, especially for immigrant bias, they have no clue what they are talking sometimes.  They are not familiar with the rules.  They would tell us information that is incorrect.  And they would tell us, like, information inconsistently.  They will tell us information precisely.  So this is a specific procedure that we need to confirm.  If you're fine, if you feel like you're uncomfortable for this type of question,  you can just simply reply as well, like you're not comfortable to ask this question,  and then you can give a call and discuss that.

Gary, if you deal with me, because later I also want to help on the corporation stuff.  If we work long term, I like this. I'm the kind of guy that I'm not getting offensive very easily.  very easy.

That would be great, yes.  It's a standard procedure, so we wouldn't submit everything without getting your approval, so don't worry about it.  We just need some time to review and process it.  For all those questions, is there anything now you cannot answer on the checklist or whatever?  Oh, my wife actually uploads everything. I told Amanda too actually.  She only uploads it to the Google Drive so that it's easy for us to keep that inside.  And then there are a few questions she has in there, that's it.  My wife already still up. So Amanda can check that.  yeah i i would say that it's because like uh you are very proactive and intelligent in the ways that  uh it's very different uh 99 of our clients they know nothing and they need specific guidance on  everything and they need us to ask this their specific question like we we understand you're  being very proactive on everything and then and then we appreciate that and we will we try to  like a freak out how we can like do this better together so that's why I need to  get ready to call inside calm yourself down I meant that tell me I cannot come  because I don't know whether it's Gary talking",
