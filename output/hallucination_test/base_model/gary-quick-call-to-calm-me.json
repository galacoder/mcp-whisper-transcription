  "text": " They use a contract to raise the app. They want to take the track. They don't want to take  to pay attention to the numbers and they want to have the immigration.  Yeah, we all understand that.  And you just need to let us have some time to bring you things,  do your work, do the work, and then we'll get back to you with an answer.  And then by that time, we would have more time to discuss.  If you agree with certain approach, if you have different perspective, we will definitely  respect your differential and then we will like to know how it works.  But yeah, at this stage, I will write to them, let us give them an end of life.  Let us try to also be able to let us tell you the plan why.  Let us try to do everything.  Okay, because the reason you pay us is because you trust our professional experience, right?  Like, we will do all this work, yeah.  You know, I actually thank you for calling me out.  I've been waiting for this call for the others.  You know, for you, I do trust you because we talk and James, my girl who's reference to you  and I know you also work with other friends.  friends, his friend actually is a reference view.  So I have the trust in you.  But it just sometimes, like Amanda,  when she asked me questions, it's making it worse,  to be honest, is, I know you got a professional,  I know you got a busy, I know you're busy.  And that's why for me, I'm kind of guy, come on.  I grow up in a place where it's a community's country, right?  So I would take everything responsible myself.  This is my best way of doing everything.  do you see like I drag something on all this because I'm just a very, I'm just a very  you guys so busy you get miss misunderstandings or you know you do see me you know I also  like you I'm a bowler so whatever I do I do everything to account and I rather I  rather I know this actually I know I pay for you at this premium ride I know you will  do a good job but I'm just myself just this way you work with me because I think if we  It works exactly with this term.  We're gonna work together in a long time  because this means I wanna be a long term relationship.  I wanna buy someone like you.  To be honest, I want to buy someone like you.  Because, yeah.  I think I think I think here is,  I would say that usually it's a cultural thing.  I don't know if you,  it's very different than we had about,  like how we approach tax and how we approach credit.  Like the approach we are using  in certain locations about you.  In fact, we have been using home for 10 years.  So they have spent the time,  spent the discussion, and are usually  in 99 for 9% of the fees.  If our client just responds or requests,  we will get them and keep them in the client.  Which is they don't find,  and also the question, who does your...  It's like you have some wording that for example, you use  and sure someday you will be guaranteed something  or I ask you your immigration application.  Okay, I'll keep it going.  But then like you know, I kind of know professional  with then you have the phone in like home.  Because those are completely outside  like, the thing is, like, like, a CTA, like, when you were a student, it was possible for  a woman and a bride, just like the same.  So, I wanted, like, you know, like, like, some of this, like, conversation.  I believe it's just a cultural difference, or, as a few of you have really, you have  I understand that you have a lot of attention.  That's why I think this point is next story.  I know that I need to give you a call and try to understand the situation.  It's like I would say it again like we like and that that's good of us and we will have to  choose different different things.  I'm sure the point that all you feel of your culture and that we will then respond.  Yeah, because now that I'm off of pressure lodges, I would say the apparent things in different  ways, but they are just asking the same thing.  We actually comfortable some sound in the call sound.  We just go stuff week.  And this okay, because the knowledge part is different  right up by you.  We come to us.  Yes, just I would say that the particular  of all sounds, but that's actually understanding,  like, unfortunately, if you have to really be with the  knowledge and that's why it's the time to try to understand like our perspective and  why we need to do this. It's not because we want to just stay in time and not  answer your question or whatever because a lot of the time like for example I  I give you a really good example, for example, you can hold your hands, or you can mention  how much of all this is like, oh I'm not restable, and so on and so on.  And those stuff should be like completely removed from your hands because this is like  this is just over-analysis and being really paranoid and this will not happen.  Yes, because of how the NATO is like we  we have worked here with you to be friends.  So we know what it's like sometimes.  If you mind, you can get rid of those very first yes.  Yeah, yeah, but I say something.  Yes.  So thank you for calling and I just  clarified.  I agree.  I agree.  There's one thing going.  So when Amanda asked the question differently,  it would trigger me.  Because I went after I came to you guys,  I always did the law study today.  And I know you guys are one of the top.  And that's why I decided to go with you guys  and review specifically to be honest,  because I talked to you as well, trust me.  So like when Amanda asked me questions  where the way she talked, you know,  I'm a detail all together.  Come on, I'm a fucking father, right?  I'm a father, so I have businesses.  I'm at this age, you know, I mean,  it's beyond a law of law.  And it's not, it's okay, all this thing.  I'm not sure.  I'm sure that I have limited knowledge intact.  That's why I'm here with you, right?  Because you know all this.  And I learned to work with you.  I would say it doesn't feel like I'm pretty  50 much emotion.  In the email, it is a standard approach to share when there is a question or both questions.  We ask the same questions to over 500 to about the client.  So please post, take over over and analyze about both.  And as you may want to different poses, like I don't know, like in a professional setting or out to know,  They are this pamphlet, like, do you think it's just certain thing?  You think it's not professional?  That's my concern now, like, really?  I mean, if it's you, I just come from you, like telling me,  hey, it's Gary telling me, okay, so we're gonna,  because when she asks the questions, okay,  so they're gonna do like this, they're gonna keep the 60,000s,  right?  So she asks my wife, okay, the one thing is,  asked me okay I was like oh come on I need more assessment from Gary because I  don't know whether it's come from her Amanda.  I was thinking you can have a parent vacation right like that you don't need it.  I think one of the problems like being that we need to be really important by finding  and it's real professional and kind of unique  when we have that we love to complain  in those under our current soul.  Like our plans should not just rely on  behind words of like most of the whole correspondence  of course as part of the service, okay?  So when we start the soul thing,  we always want to go to the soul.  and I think that's something to do if you need clarification and you just need to respond.  You can say no, then you explain certain things why you make this gesture.  We are all trying to give you more explanation.  However, if you just reply, yes, you agree, but later on, you actually feel free.  That's not an effective communication.  So, regardless what position it is, because I cannot do everything, like I can have over  like only a country of this type of case every year.  And then...  That's also... that's what I think I worry too.  That's what I think I worry.  Yeah.  Everyone just comes to meet and confirm everything about the health.  So I mean, please don't take it like personally or take it as an emotion.  If you want more details, if you want to care for what's happening,  then we just focus on that question and try to help us to do the ability.  And for now, what we want, what we don't want is our client raising a lot of different  new questions or just paraphrasing all the questions and answers that ask for the same thing.  The thing is, we understand how our clients want to achieve the goals.  We are investing both.  We just want to make sure you give us time to do our work.  No, I definitely will give you guys time to just tell me where.  Or tell Amanda, hey give us two days, I will answer you this.  I mean she responds really quick, really fast.  I like it.  But the one thing is I don't feel like certain or I don't feel like  you like like three of mine, you know what I mean?  Like if it's you, you call it, you talk.  It just like, it's, yeah.  I just want to explicitly tell you that we know the way how to do things.  So I appreciate how I am to just let them do our work.  And I feel we will give you an explanation of different things.  And because a lot of the question is not something we can advise with writing.  And if it's out of our, for example, if you mentioned IRC, or your application,  so it's not something we'd tell it's also right.  I can't just get here as a friend or as a professional outside of school,  But the thing is, it's not something that you are asking.  Oh, I mean, it just tell me, because I thought, like, the one thing is, you know, I know, like you said, you actually do all this  immigration stuff too. Like, how 10 CPAs, immigration, so I thought, because I just want, I just want, I'm  And then to when I recap it, I know it's take a lot of time for me to think about all this.  But I just want to make sure that because I don't know it's from your team.  I just feel like I'm sorry, but I just say that.  Yeah, yeah.  Lots of the work you're putting into the app for, like,  and some things that you create.  You create all this.  I would say that I live in this dress or your style and all of the stuff.  This is actually, make sure that this is actually,  she assess this and that's actually coming from your team  because I don't know, like, because I only know you.  I don't know her profile.  I have been on the outskirts name so like,  you know, it is on the outskirts name  that we are responsible for,  responsible for the public.  I'm glad to hear.  And we will, I'll meet up with you real close to each other.  And then again, yeah, become our team every day.  I have also a powerful email and a man that has a powerful manager for sure.  So we are very interested in our clients, but in the real estate side, if you want a bit more  to be careful on things, just do think that we have people, you have to really have things.  Yeah, I mean, that's why, you know, like, hey, I think that's the right way that you call  Because maybe I'm always a little different than all people.  It's just my way of doing this.  Yes, yes, yes.  I just wanted to show that I get the different information.  And that in Canada, we were able to be multicultural,  be effective in our complications by us.  But when we handle this kind of sensitive factors,  we need our clients to follow all of this.  Yeah, I definitely, but just tell the one thing, I also have a lot of clients, so I work with clients.  So different clients, they have a different way of communication, not everyone's the same.  So for sure, we are working together.  For sure, the way you call me like this, you're not trimming me like every client.  So we call you telling me this and this being like, you actually take into consideration that I have a little bit of concern that you call,  which is a great way for you to be successful back.  Exactly what I'm gonna do too.  It's just like, sometimes I would do,  because if Amanda, if she just say things,  she's in a way that it's just,  you know, it's not emotional,  but for me, it's just good for me.  Oh, she don't know that.  Is that just come for me?  I would say that if this is,  it's because she is,  because it's a different thing, right?  Like, a lot of the time,  I realized that I was trying to just give you  much information where we ask, like, as we would be excited, like, what you should do  there. Yeah, and actually only rather information, the 10, maybe basically, I mean, two  future hours, like, like, one of the information I would talk about, like, a consumer, which is  not helpful when we are really busy. Yeah, I also want to, like, emphasize one point  like usually in similar cases, for clients like Nestle, only give them like certain  minutes call. Like because you're prepared by them, like we actually give you a lot of  interesting comfort for them. But I still understand you still have a lot of professional  But I think you get a little  Not certain about that  Gary if you said so I would love to I hate I you know you said so I just want to know like okay  Gary and a team already can see the information. That's why I just want Amanda to say and if that the case that I'm fine  What do you say?  So I'm saying is like, because you said that right now,  I'm saying, you know, I already take everything  to considerations and our team too.  So I just, because I meant that when she answered  and asked me a question, I'm scared, because I don't know  where it is from, your team was from you or it's just from her.  Because I don't know how you're not.  Yeah, you just over analyze.  Yeah, so.  and have questions like in a lot of our cases,  like our especially for irreversible fires,  they have no clue what they're talking sometimes.  They're not below the rules.  They would tell us information that is incorrect.  And they would tell us information consistently.  And they would tell us information by the use.  I really do it.  But yeah, it's intended.  Gary, I, if you knew what I think, because later, you know, I also wanted you to help  on the, the, the preparation stuff.  If you, we work at long time, I, I like this one.  I'm the kind of guy that I, I, I, I'm not getting offensive very easily.  I want you to throw at me whatever, you feel like I'm not doing the right thing.  Because.  I'm coming to an SSB because I feel like I'm getting caught.  Yeah.  That's why I love to work with Hong Kong people, right?  You guys are this and then I don't, I do something that is cap out the line, you say, hey,  it's a little out the line, it's a little out here, I'll listen.  But I would love to hear and I would love to hear from you because I know like, because  I only know you right now, I don't know Amanda, if like you and you and Amanda, I don't  know like what in coordinator to be honest, I don't know what kind of person I am.  My purpose of my cause is just how it's not really stressful here at all.  A lot of the time, I need to be honest with you.  I feel like I have a lot of information which is not usually read exactly fine.  and then I did have two information.  So, no alternative.  It's just, we want to make sure our client expectation is not the same time we need to connect the our expectation.  Sometimes we work with a lot of the structures, for example,  they over analyze the wall and it looks like an example or make it like a research paper  paper and then we would directly tell them, no, like, the solve. Like, we are trying to get the text  of the solve. We are not trying to have a, uh, Hey, um, Gary, Gary, I'm a, I'm a fucking tech guy,  right? I'm a fucking tech guy, okay? And you know, tech guy can be very intelligent, you know  it. And I'm also businessman like you. So, uh, but yes, you tell me, hey, we got it, I got it,  Hey, I trust you. I trust you. That's why I signed the bill.  We will give you another discussion. We will have another discussion on the finish.  Actually, there are four weeks that they did.  It's a standard procedure. We wouldn't submit everything ourselves.  I guess it's your proof of solvulgaria.  We just need some time to be good for that.  For all the questions, is there anything now you can answer  or the checklist or whatever?  Oh, she had my wife actually uploaded everything.  I also told Amanda to actually only upload  to the Google Drive and so that it's easy for to keep that  inside and then there are a few questions she had  and that's it.  My wife really still up.  So, Amanda can check that.  Yeah, I would say that it turns like you are very active and intelligent in the way that it's very different.  Many people are behinding or nothing and they need specific ideas on every day and they need us to act as their specific expression.  We understand your being very proactive on everything and then we appreciate that and we will research  about how we can do this better together.  So that's why I need to get ready to call.  They said come yourself down.  I might not tell me I cannot call because I don't know whether this Gary talking or she's...  I think they have four absolutely overall  of actual service deals,  I call them by fire and stuff.  They should know what they think,  something that is not a hundred possession  or a lot of the email that actually is real in front of us.  So, I really think that's my travel tax advisory,  when we put only a tag that's five in rate range also be built by us.  So, this time on a five-series will take us from thousand.  We have only the company, all that they have like over a billion dollars.  So, yeah, we will, like, we will protect our own business.  Please protect.  Please protect me, Gary.  I really did your expertise right here.  I just want you to notice this out case, please.  And I'm going to add...  It's actually, she is kind of, you know...  Yeah, at the same time we, I think the overall is just, uh, uh,",

And for now, what we want, what we don't want is our client raising a lot of different  new questions or just paraphrasing all the questions and answers that ask for the same thing.  The thing is, we understand how our clients want to achieve the goals.  We are investing both.  We just want to make sure you give us time to do our work.  No, I definitely will give you guys time to just tell me where.  Or tell Amanda, hey give us two days, I will answer you this.  I mean she responds really quick, really fast.  I like it.  But the one thing is I don't feel like certain or I don't feel like  you like like three of mine, you know what I mean?  Like if it's you, you call it, you talk.  It just like, it's, yeah.",

Yes, yes, yes.  I just wanted to show that I get the different information.  And that in Canada, we were able to be multicultural,  be effective in our complications by us.  But when we handle this kind of sensitive factors,  we need our clients to follow all of this.  Yeah, I definitely, but just tell the one thing, I also have a lot of clients, so I work with clients.  So different clients, they have a different way of communication, not everyone's the same.  So for sure, we are working together.  For sure, the way you call me like this, you're not trimming me like every client.  So we call you telling me this and this being like, you actually take into consideration that I have a little bit of concern that you call,  which is a great way for you to be successful back.  Exactly what I'm gonna do too.

Yeah, I also want to, like, emphasize one point  like usually in similar cases, for clients like Nestle, only give them like certain  minutes call.
