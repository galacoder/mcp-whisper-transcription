      "text": " They use a contract to raise the app. They want to take the track. They don't want to take  to pay attention to the numbers and they want to have the immigration.  Yeah, we all understand that.  And you just need to let us have some time to bring you things,  do your work, do the work, and then we'll get back to you with an answer.  And then by that time, we would have more time to discuss.  If you agree with certain approach, if you have different perspective, we will definitely  respect your differential and then we will like to know how it works.  But yeah, at this stage, I will write to them, let us give them an end of life.  Let us try to also be able to let us tell you the plan why.  Let us try to do everything.  Okay, because the reason you pay us is because you trust our professional experience, right?  Like, we will do all this work, yeah.  You know, I actually thank you for calling me out.  I've been waiting for this call for the others.  You know, for you, I do trust you because we talk and James, my girl who's reference to you  and I know you also work with other friends.  friends, his friend actually is a reference view.  So I have the trust in you.  But it just sometimes, like Amanda,  when she asked me questions, it's making it worse,  to be honest, is, I know you got a professional,  I know you got a busy, I know you're busy.  And that's why for me, I'm kind of guy, come on.  I grow up in a place where it's a community's country, right?  So I would take everything responsible myself.  This is my best way of doing everything.  do you see like I drag something on all this because I'm just a very, I'm just a very  you guys so busy you get miss misunderstandings or you know you do see me you know I also  like you I'm a bowler so whatever I do I do everything to account and I rather I  rather I know this actually I know I pay for you at this premium ride I know you will  do a good job but I'm just myself just this way you work with me because I think if we  It works exactly with this term.  We're gonna work together in a long time  because this means I wanna be a long term relationship.  I wanna buy someone like you to be honest.  I want to buy someone like you because you know.  I think I think I think here is,  I would say that usually it's a cultural thing.  I don't know if you,  it's very different than we had about,  like how we approach tax and how we approach credit.  Like the approach we are using  in certain locations about you.  In fact, we have been using home for 10 years.  So they have spent the time,  spent the discussion, and are usually  in 99 for 9% of the fees.  If our client just responds or requests,  we will get them and keep them in the client.  Which is they don't find,  and also the question, who does your...  It's like you have some wording that for example, you use  and sure someday you will be guaranteed something  or I ask you your immigration application.  Okay, I'll keep it going.  But then like you know, I kind of know professional  with then you have the phone in like home.  Because those are completely outside  like, the thing is, like, like, a CTA, like, when you were a student, it was possible for  a woman and a bride, just like the same.  So, I wanted, like, you know, like, like, some of this, like, conversation.  I believe it's just a cultural difference, or, as a few of you have really, you have  I understand that you have a lot of attention.  That's why I think this point is next story.  I know that I need to give you a call and try to understand the situation.  It's like I would say it again like we like and that that's good of us and we will have to  choose different different things.  I'm sure the point that all you feel of your culture and that we will then respond.  Yeah, because now that I'm off of pressure lodges, I would say the apparent things in different  ways, but they are just asking the same thing.  We actually comfortable some sound in the call sound.  We just go stuff week.  And this is okay because the knowledge part is different  right up by you.  We come to us.  Yes, just I would say that the particular  of all sounds that are please understand that  like unfortunately if you have to really be with the  knowledge and that's why it's the time to try to understand like our perspective and  why we need to do this. It's not because we want to just stay in time and not  answer your question or whatever because a lot of the time like for example I  I give you a really good example, for example, you can hold your hands, or you can mention  hold your shoulders like, oh I'm not restful, and so on and so on.  And those are, should be like completely removed from your body, because this is like,  this is show over analyze and being really paranoid and this will not happen.  Yes, because of how the NATO is like we  we have worked here with you to be friends.  We know what it's like sometimes.  If you mind, you can get rid of those very first yes.  Yeah, yeah, but I say something.  Yes.  So thank you for calling and I just  clarified.  I agree.  I agree.  There's one thing going.  So when Amanda asked the question differently,  it would trigger me.  Because I went after I came to you guys,  I always did the law study today.  And I know you guys are one of the top.  And that's why I decided to go with you guys  and review specifically to be honest,  because I talked to you as well, trust me.  So like when Amanda asked me questions  where the way she talked, you know,  I'm a detail all together.  Come on, I'm a fucking father, right?  I'm a father, so I have businesses.  I'm at this age, you know, I mean,  it's beyond a law of law.  And it's not, it's okay, all this thing.  I'm not sure.  I'm sure that I have limited knowledge intact.  That's why I'm here with you, right?  Because you know all this.  And I learned to work with you.  I would say it doesn't feel like I'm pretty  50 much emotion.  In the email, it is a standard approach to share when there is a question or both questions.  We ask the same questions to over 500 to about the client.  So please post, take over over and analyze about both.  And as you may want to different poses, like I don't know, like in a professional setting or out to know,  They are this pamphlet, like, do you think it's just certain thing?  You think it's not professional?  That's my concern now, like, really?  I mean, if it's you, I just come from you, like telling me,  hey, it's Gary telling me, okay, so we're gonna,  because when she asks the questions, okay,  so they're gonna do like this, they're gonna keep the 60,000s,  right?  So she asks my wife, okay, the one thing is,  or ask me, okay, I was like, oh, come on,  I need more assessment from Gary,  because I don't know whether it's come from her, Amanda.  I was thinking of you.  I can have a parent, a patient, right?  Like that, you don't need it.  I think one of the problems like being that we need to be  really important by finding this real professional  I'm trying to get to know you  We have a lot to complain about under our current soul.  Our plan should not just rely on the high work of like most of the whole correspondence  of course as part of the service.  So when we take the soul to aim, we are responsible for that.  So when I'm saying something to you, if you need clarification,  you just need to respond, you can say no, then you explain certain things why you make this  pressure. We are all trying to give you more explanation. However, if you just reply  yes, you agree, but later on you actually disagree, that's not an effective communication.  Okay, so regardless what position we're supposed to hit, because I cannot do everything,  I think we have a lot of interest in this problem.  Every year.  That's what I think I worry about.  That's what I think I worry.  Everyone just comes to me to confirm everything about the health.  If you want to be a person like me, or if you want to be a person, if you want to be a person,  then please just focus on that question and try to ask us to be the absolute.  And for now, what we want, what we don't want is our client releasing a lot of different  new questions or just paraphrasing all the questions and answers that ask for the same thing.  The thing is, we understand how our client wants to achieve the goals.  We are investing both.  We just want to make sure you keep us fine.  We do all of that.  No, I definitely will give you guys time to just tell me where.  Or tell Amanda, hey, give us two days.  I will answer you this.  I mean, she responded really quick, really fast.  I like it.  But the one thing is, I don't feel like certain or I don't feel like free of mind.  explicitly how you that we would know the way how to do things so I appreciate I am  to just let them see you all work and I think we will give you an explanation of different things  and because a lot of the question is not something we can advise in writing and if it's out of our  our, for example, if you mentioned IRC, or your application, so it's not something  we, we, for IP tell it's also right. I can't just get your as a friend or as a, as a  I'm so rational outside of school, but the thing is not so effective or I'm very...  Yeah, exactly.  No, I mean, it just tell me, you know, because I thought like the one thing is, you know,  I know, like you said, you actually do all this immigration stuff to the cow-ten CPA,  the speed relations, so I thought...  Yeah, I just want...  No, I just want...  I just want Amanda to, when I recap it, I know it's...  It's take a lot of time for me to think about all this but I just want to make sure that because I don't know  I'm sorry.  Hey, we are businessmen.  It's okay to throw me things.  And I listen.  Yeah, I just want to, you just tell Amanda,  maybe just my style, just when say something,  or when do a new thing, just telling me like,  okay, this is actually, make sure that this is actually,  she assess this and that's actually coming from your team  because I don't know, like, because I only know you.  I don't know her profile.  So, like you do not even know the name, we are responsible for our response.  I'm glad to hear.  And we have been available to teachers.  And then again, yeah, because our team, every day, like myself, I have also a powerful email.  And the man that happens also, I'm sure for sure.  So we are very interested in our point, but we really think that many, if you want a bit more  to come from things, just simply, yeah, we have people, yeah, I have to say, yeah.  Yeah, I mean, that's why, you know, like, hey, I think that's the right way that you call  communication. Because maybe I'm always a little different in law people, which is my way of doing  Yes, yes, yes.  I just wanted to show that I get the percentage of that.  In Canada, we were willing to be multicultural,  we were affected by complications by others.  But when we handle this kind of sensitive factors,  we need our clients to follow up.  Yeah, yeah, I definitely,  but just tell the one thing,  I also have a lot of clients,  So different clients, they have a different way of communication, not everyone's the same.  So for sure, we are working together.  For sure, the way you call me like this, you're not trimming me like every client.  So we call you telling me this and you're actually taking to consideration that I have a little bit of concern that you call,  which is a great thing for you to do.  So that's exactly what I'm going to do too.  to. It's just like, sometimes I would do like because if Amanda, if she just say things  like, she's in a way that it's just, you know, it's not emotional for me to give me,  like, oh, she don't know that. Is that just come for me?  I would say that if this is, it's because it's a distraction, right?  Like, a lot of the time, I realized that I was buying just to give too much information  when we ask, like, do we want to be excited  or be like, like, the YouTube, the other kind of question.  Yeah, and actually only about information,  of course, the 10, maybe basically,  I mean, to filter out, like,  one of the information out of, like,  our customers, which is not helpful  or when we are really busy.  Yeah, I also want to, like, emphasize one point  And the side one point is usually in similar cases,  for clients like Nestle only gives them  like certain minutes call.  Like because you're prepared by them,  like we actually give you a lot of interest  for the project.  But I still understand you still have a lot  of professional users,  but I think you'll be a bit more  not-trippin' bored about that.  But of your users,  like I understand your how to keep those and your concerns.  You think we can think of that for too much of a narrow?  Gary, if you said so, I would love to.  I hate you, you said so.  I just want to know, okay, Gary and the team already  can see it all information.  That's why I just want Amanda to say.  And if it's that, the case that I'm buying, I don't want to.  You're really worth the year, what do you say?  So I'm saying it's like, because you said that right now,  I only take everything to consideration.  I'll team too.  I meant that when she answered and asked me questions,  I'm scared because I don't know whether it's from your team  or from you or it's just from her.  I don't know her enough.  You just over analyzed.  Like in a lot of our cases, like our especially for  in reverse fire they have no clue what they are talking sometimes they are not  familiar with the previous they would tell us information that is incorrect and they  would tell us like information in consistently and they would tell us information  so this is the most effective, like the chair that we need to come up with,  if you're a fire, if you feel like you're a fire,  or you're a fire on the front chair, you can use the same fire as a fire,  like you're not comfortable with the job, you're on depression,  and then you're a test of your feeling more and discuss that.  For this type of discussion that we want,  I don't mean you are trying to award that kind of thing as long as you really do it.  Gary, I, if you knew what I mean because later you know I was so wanted to help on the  cooperation stuff.  If you, we work at long time, I like this much.  I'm the kind of guy that I, I'm not getting offensive very easily.  I want you to throw at me whatever you feel like I'm not doing the right thing.  I don't know if I can tell you that because they like that.  That's just being honest.  That's why I love to work with Hong Kong people, right?  You guys are honest, and then I don't know if I do something that is cap out the line.  You say, hey, it's a little out the line.  Oh, I'll hear. I'll listen.  But I would love to hear. And I would love to hear from you.  Because I know like, because I only know you right now.  I don't know Amanda. If like you would treat me like Amanda.  I don't know like what in coordinator to be honest.  I don't know what kind of...  We want to make sure our client expectation is not the same time we need to connect the out of the presentation.  Sometimes we work with a lot of the staffers, like Trump, or say over analyze the work.  And it looks like an example, or make it like a research paper, and then we would directly tell them,  We are trying to get the text from the phone.  We are not trying to have a...  Gary, I'm a fucking tech guy.  I'm a fucking tech guy, okay.  And you know, tech guy can be very intelligent.  And you know it.  And I'm also businessman like you.  But yes, you tell me, hey, we got it.  I trust you.  I trust you.  That's why I signed with you.  We will give you another discussion.  We will have another discussion on the finish.  Everything and before we start the discussion.  It's a standard procedure.  When we were doing something, everything I would solve  gets a few of proof of solving.  Don't worry about it.  We just need some time to be good for that.  question is that anything now you can answer or the checklist or whatever. Oh she  have my wife actually upload everything I also told Amanda to actually she  already uploaded to the Google Drive and so that it's easy for to keep that  inside and then there are a few questions she had and that's it my wife is  still up so I'm in that  intelligence in the way that it's very different.  Many people are behinding or nothing and they need  specific ideas on every day and they need us to  actively inspecting the infection.  Like we understand you're being very proactive  on everything and then we appreciate that and we will  we'll try to like approach all how we can  like do this better together.  So that's why I need to get ready to call.  They say, come yourself down.  And my dad tell me I cannot call because I don't go  with this Gary talking or she's.  I think they have four absolutely overall  or rationalized service skills.  I call them five years and stuff.  They should still want to think something  that is not 100% sure.  a lot of the emails are actually built by us.  So, I really do.  That's why I share about tax advisory.  When we put only a tax advisory in lane lane,  also we built a tax.  Yeah.  So, we have this time on advisory,  it will take us 1,000.  We have only the company,  the old that they have like over a billion dollars.  So yeah, we will protect our own family.  No, please protect me.  Gary, I really did your expertise right here.  I just want you to notice this out case, please.  And I'm going to ask you.  But actually, she is kind of, you know,  Yeah, at the same time, I think the overall is just...",

So when Amanda asked the question differently,  it would trigger me.  Because I went after I came to you guys,  I always did the law study today.  And I know you guys are one of the top.  And that's why I decided to go with you guys  and review specifically to be honest,  because I talked to you as well, trust me.  So like when Amanda asked me questions  where the way she talked, you know,  I'm a detail all together.  Come on, I'm a fucking father, right?  I'm a father, so I have businesses.  I'm at this age, you know, I mean,  it's beyond a law of law.  And it's not, it's okay, all this thing.  I'm not sure.  I'm sure that I have limited knowledge intact.  That's why I'm here with you, right?  Because you know all this.  And I learned to work with you.  I would say it doesn't feel like I'm pretty  50 much emotion.  In the email, it is a standard approach to share when there is a question or both questions.  We ask the same questions to over 500 to about the client.  So please post, take over over and analyze about both.  And as you may want to different poses, like I don't know, like in a professional setting or out to know,  They are this pamphlet, like, do you think it's just certain thing?  You think it's not professional?  That's my concern now, like, really?  I mean, if it's you, I just come from you, like telling me,  hey, it's Gary telling me, okay, so we're gonna,  because when she asks the questions, okay,  so they're gonna do like this, they're gonna keep the 60,000s,  right?  So she asks my wife, okay, the one thing is,  or ask me, okay, I was like, oh, come on,  I need more assessment from Gary,  because I don't know whether it's come from her, Amanda.  I was thinking of you.  I can have a parent, a patient, right?  Like that, you don't need it.  I think one of the problems like being that we need to be  really important by finding this real professional  I'm trying to get to know you  We have a lot to complain about under our current soul.  Our plan should not just rely on the high work of like most of the whole correspondence  of course as part of the service.  So when we take the soul to aim, we are responsible for that.  So when I'm saying something to you, if you need clarification,  you just need to respond, you can say no, then you explain certain things why you make this  pressure. We are all trying to give you more explanation. However, if you just reply  yes, you agree, but later on you actually disagree, that's not an effective communication.  Okay, so regardless what position we're supposed to hit, because I cannot do everything,  I think we have a lot of interest in this problem.  Every year.  That's what I think I worry about.  That's what I think I worry.  Everyone just comes to me to confirm everything about the health.  If you want to be a person like me, or if you want to be a person, if you want to be a person,  then please just focus on that question and try to ask us to be the absolute.  And for now, what we want, what we don't want is our client releasing a lot of different  new questions or just paraphrasing all the questions and answers that ask for the same thing.  The thing is, we understand how our client wants to achieve the goals.  We are investing both.  We just want to make sure you keep us fine.  We do all of that.  No, I definitely will give you guys time to just tell me where.  Or tell Amanda, hey, give us two days.  I will answer you this.  I mean, she responded really quick, really fast.  I like it.  But the one thing is, I don't feel like certain or I don't feel like free of mind.",

Yeah, I just want to, you just tell Amanda,  maybe just my style, just when say something,  or when do a new thing, just telling me like,  okay, this is actually, make sure that this is actually,  she assess this and that's actually coming from your team  because I don't know, like, because I only know you.  I don't know her profile.  So, like you do not even know the name, we are responsible for our response.  I'm glad to hear.  And we have been available to teachers.  And then again, yeah, because our team, every day, like myself, I have also a powerful email.  And the man that happens also, I'm sure for sure.  So we are very interested in our point, but we really think that many, if you want a bit more  to come from things, just simply, yeah, we have people, yeah, I have to say, yeah.  Yeah, I mean, that's why, you know, like, hey, I think that's the right way that you call  communication. Because maybe I'm always a little different in law people, which is my way of doing  Yes, yes, yes.  I just wanted to show that I get the percentage of that.  In Canada, we were willing to be multicultural,  we were affected by complications by others.  But when we handle this kind of sensitive factors,  we need our clients to follow up.  Yeah, yeah, I definitely,  but just tell the one thing,  I also have a lot of clients,  So different clients, they have a different way of communication, not everyone's the same.  So for sure, we are working together.  For sure, the way you call me like this, you're not trimming me like every client.  So we call you telling me this and you're actually taking to consideration that I have a little bit of concern that you call,  which is a great thing for you to do.  So that's exactly what I'm going to do too.  to. It's just like, sometimes I would do like because if Amanda, if she just say things  like, she's in a way that it's just, you know, it's not emotional for me to give me,  like, oh, she don't know that. Is that just come for me?  I would say that if this is, it's because it's a distraction, right?  Like, a lot of the time, I realized that I was buying just to give too much information  when we ask, like, do we want to be excited  or be like, like, the YouTube, the other kind of question.  Yeah, and actually only about information,  of course, the 10, maybe basically,  I mean, to filter out, like,  one of the information out of, like,  our customers, which is not helpful  or when we are really busy.  Yeah, I also want to, like, emphasize one point  And the side one point is usually in similar cases,  for clients like Nestle only gives them  like certain minutes call.  Like because you're prepared by them,  like we actually give you a lot of interest  for the project.  But I still understand you still have a lot  of professional users,  but I think you'll be a bit more  not-trippin' bored about that.  But of your users,  like I understand your how to keep those and your concerns.  You think we can think of that for too much of a narrow?  Gary, if you said so, I would love to.  I hate you, you said so.  I just want to know, okay, Gary and the team already  can see it all information.  That's why I just want Amanda to say.  And if it's that, the case that I'm buying, I don't want to.  You're really worth the year, what do you say?  So I'm saying it's like, because you said that right now,  I only take everything to consideration.  I'll team too.  I meant that when she answered and asked me questions,  I'm scared because I don't know whether it's from your team  or from you or it's just from her.  I don't know her enough.  You just over analyzed.  Like in a lot of our cases, like our especially for  in reverse fire they have no clue what they are talking sometimes they are not  familiar with the previous they would tell us information that is incorrect and they  would tell us like information in consistently and they would tell us information  so this is the most effective, like the chair that we need to come up with,  if you're a fire, if you feel like you're a fire,  or you're a fire on the front chair, you can use the same fire as a fire,  like you're not comfortable with the job, you're on depression,  and then you're a test of your feeling more and discuss that.  For this type of discussion that we want,  I don't mean you are trying to award that kind of thing as long as you really do it.  Gary, I, if you knew what I mean because later you know I was so wanted to help on the  cooperation stuff.  If you, we work at long time, I like this much.  I'm the kind of guy that I, I'm not getting offensive very easily.  I want you to throw at me whatever you feel like I'm not doing the right thing.  I don't know if I can tell you that because they like that.  That's just being honest.  That's why I love to work with Hong Kong people, right?  You guys are honest, and then I don't know if I do something that is cap out the line.  You say, hey, it's a little out the line.  Oh, I'll hear. I'll listen.  But I would love to hear. And I would love to hear from you.  Because I know like, because I only know you right now.  I don't know Amanda. If like you would treat me like Amanda.  I don't know like what in coordinator to be honest.  I don't know what kind of...",

      "text": " They use a contract to raise the app. They want to take the track. They don't want to take  to pay attention to the numbers and they want to have the immigration.  Yeah, we all understand that.  And you just need to let us have some time to bring you things,  do your work, do the work, and then we'll get back to you with an answer.  And then by that time, we would have more time to discuss.  If you agree with certain approach, if you have different perspective, we will definitely  respect your differential and then we will like to know how it works.  But yeah, at this stage, I will write to them, let us give them an end of life.  Let us try to also be able to let us tell you the plan why.  Let us try to do everything.  Okay, because the reason you pay us is because you trust our professional experience, right?  Like, we will do all this work, yeah.  You know, I actually thank you for calling me out.  I've been waiting for this call for the others.  You know, for you, I do trust you because we talk and James, my girl who's reference to you  and I know you also work with other friends.  friends, his friend actually is a reference view.  So I have the trust in you.  But it just sometimes, like Amanda,  when she asked me questions, it's making it worse,  to be honest, is, I know you got a professional,  I know you got a busy, I know you're busy.  And that's why for me, I'm kind of guy, come on.  I grow up in a place where it's a community's country, right?  So I would take everything responsible myself.  This is my best way of doing everything.  do you see like I drag something on all this because I'm just a very, I'm just a very  you guys so busy you get miss misunderstandings or you know you do see me you know I also  like you I'm a bowler so whatever I do I do everything to account and I rather I  rather I know this actually I know I pay for you at this premium ride I know you will  do a good job but I'm just myself just this way you work with me because I think if we  It works exactly with this term.  We're gonna work together in a long time  because this means I wanna be a long term relationship.  I wanna buy someone like you to be honest.  I want to buy someone like you because you know.  I think I think I think here is,  I would say that usually it's a cultural thing.  I don't know if you,  it's very different than we had about,  like how we approach tax and how we approach credit.  Like the approach we are using  in certain locations about you.  In fact, we have been using home for 10 years.  So they have spent the time,  spent the discussion, and are usually  in 99 for 9% of the fees.  If our client just responds or requests,  we will get them and keep them in the client.  Which is they don't find,  and also the question, who does your...  It's like you have some wording that for example, you use  and sure someday you will be guaranteed something  or I ask you your immigration application.  Okay, I'll keep it going.  But then like you know, I kind of know professional  with then you have the phone in like home.  Because those are completely outside  like, the thing is, like, like, a CTA, like, when you were a student, it was possible for  a woman and a bride, just like the same.  So, I wanted, like, you know, like, like, some of this, like, conversation.  I believe it's just a cultural difference, or, as a few of you have really, you have  I understand that you have a lot of attention.  That's why I think this point is next story.  I know that I need to give you a call and try to understand the situation.  It's like I would say it again like we like and that that's good of us and we will have to  choose different different things.  I'm sure the point that all you feel of your culture and that we will then respond.  Yeah, because now that I'm off of pressure lodges, I would say the apparent things in different  ways, but they are just asking the same thing.  We actually comfortable some sound in the call sound.  We just go stuff week.  And this is okay because the knowledge part is different  right up by you.  We come to us.  Yes, just I would say that the particular  of all sounds that are please understand that  like unfortunately if you have to really be with the  knowledge and that's why it's the time to try to understand like our perspective and  why we need to do this. It's not because we want to just stay in time and not  answer your question or whatever because a lot of the time like for example I  I give you a really good example, for example, you can hold your hands, or you can mention  hold your shoulders like, oh I'm not restful, and so on and so on.  And those are, should be like completely removed from your body, because this is like,  this is show over analyze and being really paranoid and this will not happen.  Yes, because of how the NATO is like we  we have worked here with you to be friends.  We know what it's like sometimes.  If you mind, you can get rid of those very first yes.  Yeah, yeah, but I say something.  Yes.  So thank you for calling and I just  clarified.  I agree.  I agree.  There's one thing going.  So when Amanda asked the question differently,  it would trigger me.  Because I went after I came to you guys,  I always did the law study today.  And I know you guys are one of the top.  And that's why I decided to go with you guys  and review specifically to be honest,  because I talked to you as well, trust me.  So like when Amanda asked me questions  where the way she talked, you know,  I'm a detail all together.  Come on, I'm a fucking father, right?  I'm a father, so I have businesses.  I'm at this age, you know, I mean,  it's beyond a law of law.  And it's not, it's okay, all this thing.  I'm not sure.  I'm sure that I have limited knowledge intact.  That's why I'm here with you, right?  Because you know all this.  And I learned to work with you.  I would say it doesn't feel like I'm pretty  50 much emotion.  In the email, it is a standard approach to share when there is a question or both questions.  We ask the same questions to over 500 to about the client.  So please post, take over over and analyze about both.  And as you may want to different poses, like I don't know, like in a professional setting or out to know,  They are this pamphlet, like, do you think it's just certain thing?  You think it's not professional?  That's my concern now, like, really?  I mean, if it's you, I just come from you, like telling me,  hey, it's Gary telling me, okay, so we're gonna,  because when she asks the questions, okay,  so they're gonna do like this, they're gonna keep the 60,000s,  right?  So she asks my wife, okay, the one thing is,  or ask me, okay, I was like, oh, come on,  I need more assessment from Gary,  because I don't know whether it's come from her, Amanda.  I was thinking of you.  I can have a parent, a patient, right?  Like that, you don't need it.  I think one of the problems like being that we need to be  really important by finding this real professional  I'm trying to get to know you  We have a lot to complain about under our current soul.  Our plan should not just rely on the high work of like most of the whole correspondence  of course as part of the service.  So when we take the soul to aim, we are responsible for that.  So when I'm saying something to you, if you need clarification,  you just need to respond, you can say no, then you explain certain things why you make this  pressure. We are all trying to give you more explanation. However, if you just reply  yes, you agree, but later on you actually disagree, that's not an effective communication.  Okay, so regardless what position we're supposed to hit, because I cannot do everything,  I think we have a lot of interest in this problem.  Every year.  That's what I think I worry about.  That's what I think I worry.  Everyone just comes to me to confirm everything about the health.  If you want to be a person like me, or if you want to be a person, if you want to be a person,  then please just focus on that question and try to ask us to be the absolute.  And for now, what we want, what we don't want is our client releasing a lot of different  new questions or just paraphrasing all the questions and answers that ask for the same thing.  The thing is, we understand how our client wants to achieve the goals.  We are investing both.  We just want to make sure you keep us fine.  We do all of that.  No, I definitely will give you guys time to just tell me where.  Or tell Amanda, hey, give us two days.  I will answer you this.  I mean, she responded really quick, really fast.  I like it.  But the one thing is, I don't feel like certain or I don't feel like free of mind.  explicitly how you that we would know the way how to do things so I appreciate I am  to just let them see you all work and I think we will give you an explanation of different things  and because a lot of the question is not something we can advise in writing and if it's out of our  our, for example, if you mentioned IRC, or your application, so it's not something  we, we, for IP tell it's also right. I can't just get your as a friend or as a, as a  I'm so rational outside of school, but the thing is not so effective or I'm very...  Yeah, exactly.  No, I mean, it just tell me, you know, because I thought like the one thing is, you know,  I know, like you said, you actually do all this immigration stuff to the cow-ten CPA,  the speed relations, so I thought...  Yeah, I just want...  No, I just want...  I just want Amanda to, when I recap it, I know it's...  It's take a lot of time for me to think about all this but I just want to make sure that because I don't know  I'm sorry.  Hey, we are businessmen.  It's okay to throw me things.  And I listen.  Yeah, I just want to, you just tell Amanda,  maybe just my style, just when say something,  or when do a new thing, just telling me like,  okay, this is actually, make sure that this is actually,  she assess this and that's actually coming from your team  because I don't know, like, because I only know you.  I don't know her profile.  So, like you do not even know the name, we are responsible for our response.  I'm glad to hear.  And we have been available to teachers.  And then again, yeah, because our team, every day, like myself, I have also a powerful email.  And the man that happens also, I'm sure for sure.  So we are very interested in our point, but we really think that many, if you want a bit more  to come from things, just simply, yeah, we have people, yeah, I have to say, yeah.  Yeah, I mean, that's why, you know, like, hey, I think that's the right way that you call  communication. Because maybe I'm always a little different in law people, which is my way of doing  Yes, yes, yes.  I just wanted to show that I get the percentage of that.  In Canada, we were willing to be multicultural,  we were affected by complications by others.  But when we handle this kind of sensitive factors,  we need our clients to follow up.  Yeah, yeah, I definitely,  but just tell the one thing,  I also have a lot of clients,  So different clients, they have a different way of communication, not everyone's the same.  So for sure, we are working together.  For sure, the way you call me like this, you're not trimming me like every client.  So we call you telling me this and you're actually taking to consideration that I have a little bit of concern that you call,  which is a great thing for you to do.  So that's exactly what I'm going to do too.  to. It's just like, sometimes I would do like because if Amanda, if she just say things  like, she's in a way that it's just, you know, it's not emotional for me to give me,  like, oh, she don't know that. Is that just come for me?  I would say that if this is, it's because it's a distraction, right?  Like, a lot of the time, I realized that I was buying just to give too much information  when we ask, like, do we want to be excited  or be like, like, the YouTube, the other kind of question.  Yeah, and actually only about information,  of course, the 10, maybe basically,  I mean, to filter out, like,  one of the information out of, like,  our customers, which is not helpful  or when we are really busy.  Yeah, I also want to, like, emphasize one point  And the side one point is usually in similar cases,  for clients like Nestle only gives them  like certain minutes call.  Like because you're prepared by them,  like we actually give you a lot of interest  for the project.  But I still understand you still have a lot  of professional users,  but I think you'll be a bit more  not-trippin' bored about that.  But of your users,  like I understand your how to keep those and your concerns.  You think we can think of that for too much of a narrow?  Gary, if you said so, I would love to.  I hate you, you said so.  I just want to know, okay, Gary and the team already  can see it all information.  That's why I just want Amanda to say.  And if it's that, the case that I'm buying, I don't want to.  You're really worth the year, what do you say?  So I'm saying it's like, because you said that right now,  I only take everything to consideration.  I'll team too.  I meant that when she answered and asked me questions,  I'm scared because I don't know whether it's from your team  or from you or it's just from her.  I don't know her enough.  You just over analyzed.  Like in a lot of our cases, like our especially for  in reverse fire they have no clue what they are talking sometimes they are not  familiar with the previous they would tell us information that is incorrect and they  would tell us like information in consistently and they would tell us information  so this is the most effective, like the chair that we need to come up with,  if you're a fire, if you feel like you're a fire,  or you're a fire on the front chair, you can use the same fire as a fire,  like you're not comfortable with the job, you're on depression,  and then you're a test of your feeling more and discuss that.  For this type of discussion that we want,  I don't mean you are trying to award that kind of thing as long as you really do it.  Gary, I, if you knew what I mean because later you know I was so wanted to help on the  cooperation stuff.  If you, we work at long time, I like this much.  I'm the kind of guy that I, I'm not getting offensive very easily.  I want you to throw at me whatever you feel like I'm not doing the right thing.  I don't know if I can tell you that because they like that.  That's just being honest.  That's why I love to work with Hong Kong people, right?  You guys are honest, and then I don't know if I do something that is cap out the line.  You say, hey, it's a little out the line.  Oh, I'll hear. I'll listen.  But I would love to hear. And I would love to hear from you.  Because I know like, because I only know you right now.  I don't know Amanda. If like you would treat me like Amanda.  I don't know like what in coordinator to be honest.  I don't know what kind of...  We want to make sure our client expectation is not the same time we need to connect the out of the presentation.  Sometimes we work with a lot of the staffers, like Trump, or say over analyze the work.  And it looks like an example, or make it like a research paper, and then we would directly tell them,  We are trying to get the text from the phone.  We are not trying to have a...  Gary, I'm a fucking tech guy.  I'm a fucking tech guy, okay.  And you know, tech guy can be very intelligent.  And you know it.  And I'm also businessman like you.  But yes, you tell me, hey, we got it.  I trust you.  I trust you.  That's why I signed with you.  We will give you another discussion.  We will have another discussion on the finish.  Everything and before we start the discussion.  It's a standard procedure.  When we were doing something, everything I would solve  gets a few of proof of solving.  Don't worry about it.  We just need some time to be good for that.  question is that anything now you can answer or the checklist or whatever. Oh she  have my wife actually upload everything I also told Amanda to actually she  already uploaded to the Google Drive and so that it's easy for to keep that  inside and then there are a few questions she had and that's it my wife is  still up so I'm in that  intelligence in the way that it's very different.  Many people are behinding or nothing and they need  specific ideas on every day and they need us to  actively inspecting the infection.  Like we understand you're being very proactive  on everything and then we appreciate that and we will  we'll try to like approach all how we can  like do this better together.  So that's why I need to get ready to call.  They say, come yourself down.  And my dad tell me I cannot call because I don't go  with this Gary talking or she's.  I think they have four absolutely overall  or rationalized service skills.  I call them five years and stuff.  They should still want to think something  that is not 100% sure.  a lot of the emails are actually built by us.  So, I really do.  That's why I share about tax advisory.  When we put only a tax advisory in lane lane,  also we built a tax.  Yeah.  So, we have this time on advisory,  it will take us 1,000.  We have only the company,  the old that they have like over a billion dollars.  So yeah, we will protect our own family.  No, please protect me.  Gary, I really did your expertise right here.  I just want you to notice this out case, please.  And I'm going to ask you.  But actually, she is kind of, you know,  Yeah, at the same time, I think the overall is just...",

I know that I need to give you a call and try to understand the situation. It's like I would say it again like we like and that that's good of us and we will have to choose different things. I'm sure the point that all you feel of your culture and that we will then respond. Yeah, because now that I'm off of pressure lodges, I would say the apparent things in different ways, but they are just asking the same thing. We actually comfortable some sound in the call sound. We just go stuff week. And this is okay because the knowledge part is different right up by you. We come to us. Yes, just I would say that the particular of all sounds that are please understand that like unfortunately if you have to really be with the knowledge and that's why it's the time to try to understand like our perspective and why we need to do this. It's not because we want to just stay in time and not answer your question or whatever because a lot of the time like for example I give you a really good example, for example, you can hold your hands, or you can mention hold your shoulders like, oh I'm not restful, and so on and so on. And those are, should be like completely removed from your body, because this is like, this is show over analyze and being really paranoid and this will not happen. Yes, because of how the NATO is like we have worked here with you to be friends. We know what it's like sometimes. If you mind, you can get rid of those very first yes. Yeah, but I say something. Yes. So thank you for calling and I just clarified. I agree. I agree. There's one thing going. So when Amanda asked the question differently, it would trigger me. Because I went after I came to you guys, I always did the law study today. And I know you guys are one of the top. And that's why I decided to go with you guys and review specifically to be honest, because I talked to you as well, trust me. So like when Amanda asked me questions where the way she talked, you know, I'm a detail all together. Come on, I'm a fucking father, right? I'm a father, so I have businesses. I'm at this age, you know, I mean, it's beyond a law of law. And it's not, it's okay, all this thing. I'm not sure. I'm sure that I have limited knowledge intact. That's why I'm here with you, right? Because you know all this. And I learned to work with you. I would say it doesn't feel like I'm pretty 50 much emotion. In the email, it is a standard approach to share when there is a question or both questions. We ask the same questions to over 500 to about the client. So please post, take over and analyze about both. And as you may want to different poses, like I don't know, like in a professional setting or out to know, They are this pamphlet, like, do you think it's just certain thing? You think it's not professional? That's my concern now, like, really? I mean, if it's you, I just come from you, like telling me, hey, it's Gary telling me, okay, so we're gonna, because when she asks the questions, okay, so they're gonna do like this, they're gonna keep the 60,000s, right? So she asks my wife, okay, the one thing is, or ask me, okay, I was like, oh, come on, I need more assessment from Gary, because I don't know whether it's come from her, Amanda. I was thinking of you. I can have a parent, a patient, right? Like that, you don't need it. I think one of the problems like being that we need to be really important by finding this real professional I'm trying to get to know you We have a lot to complain about under our current soul. Our plan should not just rely on the high work of like most of the whole correspondence of course as part of the service. So when we take the soul to aim, we are responsible for that. So when I'm saying something to you, if you need clarification, you just need to respond, you can say no, then you explain certain things why you make this pressure. We are all trying to give you more explanation. However, if you just reply yes, you agree, but later on you actually disagree, that's not an effective communication. Okay, so regardless what position we're supposed to hit, because I cannot do everything, I think we have a lot of interest in this problem. Every year. That's what I think I worry about. That's what I think I worry. Everyone just comes to me to confirm everything about the health. If you want to be a person like me, or if you want to be a person, if you want to be a person, then please just focus on that question and try to ask us to be the absolute. And for now, what we want, what we don't want is our client releasing a lot of different new questions or just paraphrasing all the questions and answers that ask for the same thing. The thing is, we understand how our client wants to achieve the goals. We are investing both. We just want to make sure you keep us fine. We do all of that. No, I definitely will give you guys time to just tell me where. Or tell Amanda, hey, give us two days. I will answer you this. I mean, she responded really quick, really fast. I like it. But the one thing is, I don't feel like certain or I don't feel like free of mind.",

          "text": "I'm sorry. Hey, we are businessmen. It's okay to throw me things. And I listen. Yeah, I just want to, you just tell Amanda, maybe just my style, just when say something, or when do a new thing, just telling me like, okay, this is actually, make sure that this is actually, she assess this and that's actually coming from your team because I don't know, like, because I only know you. I don't know her profile. So, like you do not even know the name, we are responsible for our response. I'm glad to hear. And we have been available to teachers. And then again, yeah, because our team, every day, like myself, I have also a powerful email. And the man that happens also, I'm sure for sure. So we are very interested in our point, but we really think that many, if you want a bit more to come from things, just simply, yeah, we have people, yeah, I have to say, yeah. Yeah, I mean, that's why, you know, like, hey, I think that's the right way that you call communication. Because maybe I'm always a little different in law people, which is my way of doing Yes, yes. I just wanted to show that I get the percentage of that. In Canada, we were willing to be multicultural, we were affected by complications by others. But when we handle this kind of sensitive factors, we need our clients to follow up. Yeah, I definitely, but just tell the one thing, I also have a lot of clients, So different clients, they have a different way of communication, not everyone's the same. So for sure, we are working together. For sure, the way you call me like this, you're not trimming me like every client. So we call you telling me this and you're actually taking to consideration that I have a little bit of concern that you call, which is a great thing for you to do. So that's exactly what I'm going to do too. to. It's just like, sometimes I would do like because if Amanda, if she just say things like, she's in a way that it's just, you know, it's not emotional for me to give me, like, oh, she don't know that. Is that just come for me? I would say that if this is, it's because it's a distraction, right? Like, a lot of the time, I realized that I was buying just to give too much information when we ask, like, do we want to be excited or be like, the YouTube, the other kind of question. Yeah, and actually only about information, of course, the 10, maybe basically, I mean, to filter out, like, one of the information out of, like, our customers, which is not helpful or when we are really busy. Yeah, I also want to, like, emphasize one point And the side one point is usually in similar cases, for clients like Nestle only gives them like certain minutes call. Like because you're prepared by them, like we actually give you a lot of interest for the project. But I still understand you still have a lot of professional users, but I think you'll be a bit more not-trippin' bored about that. But of your users, like I understand your how to keep those and your concerns. You think we can think of that for too much of a narrow? Gary, if you said so, I would love to. I hate you, you said so. I just want to know, okay, Gary and the team already can see it all information. That's why I just want Amanda to say. And if it's that, the case that I'm buying, I don't want to. You're really worth the year, what do you say? So I'm saying it's like, because you said that right now, I only take everything to consideration. I'll team too. I meant that when she answered and asked me questions, I'm scared because I don't know whether it's from your team or from you or it's just from her. I don't know her enough. You just over analyzed. Like in a lot of our cases, like our especially for in reverse fire they have no clue what they are talking sometimes they are not familiar with the previous they would tell us information that is incorrect and they would tell us like information in consistently and they would tell us information so this is the most effective, like the chair that we need to come up with, if you're a fire, if you feel like you're a fire, or you're a fire on the front chair, you can use the same fire as a fire, like you're not comfortable with the job, you're on depression, and then you're a test of your feeling more and discuss that. For this type of discussion that we want, I don't mean you are trying to award that kind of thing as long as you really do it. Gary, I, if you knew what I mean because later you know I was so wanted to help on the cooperation stuff. If you, we work at long time, I like this much. I'm the kind of guy that I, I'm not getting offensive very easily. I want you to throw at me whatever you feel like I'm not doing the right thing. I don't know if I can tell you that because they like that. That's just being honest. That's why I love to work with Hong Kong people, right? You guys are honest, and then I don't know if I do something that is cap out the line. You say, hey, it's a little out the line. Oh, I'll hear. I'll listen. But I would love to hear. And I would love to hear from you. Because I know like, because I only know you right now. I don't know Amanda. If like you would treat me like Amanda. I don't know like what in coordinator to be honest. I don't know what kind of...",

But the Outer Negro is actually, we know our clients want to be together.  They want to get a plan of course.  They want to take the tax.  They don't want to pay tax as a non-reference.  And they want to pass the immigration.  Yeah, we all understand that.  and you just need to like let us have some time to review your case do your work do the work and then  we will get back to you with an answer and then by that time we will have more chance to discuss  about if you agree with certain approach if you have different perspective we will definitely  like respect your decision and then we will like to know how to do it but yeah  at this stage i would i would recommend let us do the analyze let us try to  propose something let us tell you the timeline let us try to do everything okay because  the reason you pay us is you trust our professional experience right like we will do all this work yeah  You know, I actually thank you for calling though. I've been waiting for this call to be honest.  You know, for you, I do trust you because we talk and James, my bro, he reference to you and I know you also working with other friends.  His friend actually reference you. So I have the trust in you.  But it's just sometimes like Amanda when she ask me questions, it makes me worry to be honest.  I know you guys are professional, I know you guys are busy, I know you're busy.  And that's why for me, I'm a Catholic guy, come on, I grew up in a place where it's communist country, right?  So I will take everything responsible myself. This is my best way of doing everything.  Do you see like I drop something on all this because I'm just afraid you guys are so busy, you guys miss understanding.  You see me, I also like you.  I'm a founder or something.  So whatever I do, I take everything into account.  I rather, I know this is actually,  I know I paid for you at this premium price.  I know you will do a good job.  But I'm just, myself, this way you work with me  because I think if we work successfully this time,  we're gonna work together in the long term because it's me.  I wanna be in a long term relationship.  I wanna find someone like you.  To be honest, I wanna find someone like you.  because  usually in 99.9% of the case,  if our client just responds to a request,  we will give them a piece of mind.  We just need some time to inspect a lot of the questions  that you ask, like there are some wording that,  for example, if you use ensure something,  you want to guarantee something for IRCP,  your immigration application.  Okay, to be really honest, like, you know, I'm kind of professional with your response in writing because those are completely outside our advisory role.  which we appreciate, but at the same time, we want to do the way in Canada that is efficient to solve the problem.  Yes, I understand that you have lots of questions, that's why I think this call is necessary.  I know that I need to give you a call and try to explain your situation.  Just like, I would say it again, like relax and then let us do the work and then we will have the chance to discuss everything in detail until the point that you feel confident and then we will send the response.  Yeah, because now, a lot of the questions, I would say they are paraphrased in different ways, but they are just asking the same thing.  We actually took the both of them in the call that we did just last week.  and it's okay because the knowledge part is different way that's why you come to us.  I would say that, it's not to take it as an offense, but please understand that unfortunately you have really limited time and knowledge  and that's why it's the time to try to understand our perspective and why we need to do this.  It's not because we want to just take time and not answer your question or whatever.  Because a lot of the time, like for example, I give you a really good example.  For example, you cause the outrage, or you mention a whole bunch of others like, oh, I'm not restful, and blah, blah, blah, blah.  And all that should be completely removed from your mind because this is just overanalyzed and being really paranoid, and this will not help the case.  Yes, because our ultimate goal is like we are working with you to be friends with you and work out your back interest.  So we know what is the good. Sometimes in your mind you need to get rid of those very first yes.  Yeah. Yeah. May I say something? Yes. So thank you for calling and trying to clarify it.  I agree. I agree. You know, Gary, there's one thing, Gary. So when Amanda asked the question differently, it wouldn't trigger me. I just, you know, because I went after, I paid you guys, I did a lot of studies, okay? And I know you guys are one of the top.  and that's why I decided to go with you guys,  with you specifically, to be honest,  because I talk to you, so I trust you.  So, like, when Amanda asked me questions where the way she talked,  you know, I'm a detail auditor guy.  Come on, I'm a fucking founder, right?  I'm a founder. I have businesses.  I'm at this age, you know, I've been experiencing a lot of stuff.  And it's not... It's okay, all the things.  I'm not sure. I'm sure that I have unlimited...  I have limited knowledge intact.  that's why i'm here with you right because you know all this and i love to work with you  like i appreciate too much emotion in the email it's just a standard procedure when there is  questions or those questions we react the same question to over like 500 to 1000 clients so  I know people take over, over-analyze about those.  I understand you may want a different poem,  but like, I don't know, like in a professional setting  or out to melt, they are, yeah, this template,  like in fact, you think it's just certain thing,  you think it's not professional,  that's my concern now, like.  Well, I mean, if it's you,  It was coming from you, like telling me,  hey, is Gary telling me, okay, so we gotta,  because when she asked the questions,  okay, so they're gonna do like this,  they're gonna keep the 60,000, right?  So she asked my wife, okay.  The one thing is, or asked me, okay,  I was like, oh, come on, I need more assessment from Gary,  because I don't know whether it's come from her, Amanda,  or it's come from you.  Yeah, you can ask for clarification, right?  Like, yeah, you don't need it.  I think one of the common things that we need to be really  upfront with our client is we have professional accounting  jobs where we have lots of complaints.  It goes under our curve.  So our client should not just rely on my work,  but the whole correspondence and process  is part of the service.  so when we set up something we are responsible  you just need to respond you can say no can you explain certain things why you make this  judgment we are open to give you more explanation however if you just reply oh yes you agree but  later on uh you actually disagree that's not a effective communication okay so regardless  because i cannot do everything like i can have like uh over like only have hunters of this type  of case every year and then um but that's that's also that that's what i worry too that's what  want is like our clients raising a lot of different new questions or just paraphrasing  all the questions and ask for the same thing. The thing is we understand how our clients  want to achieve the goal, but we are in the same boat. So we just want to make sure you  give us time to do our work.  I definitely will give you guys time to just tell me when.  Or tell Amanda, like, hey, give us two days, I will answer you this.  I mean, she responds really quick, really fast, I like it.  But the one thing is, I don't feel  certain or I don't feel free of mind.  If it's you, you call, you talk.  Let me straightforward, we never ever received  So we appreciate our time to just let us do our work, and we will give you an explanation of different things.  And because a lot of the question is not something we can advise in writing, and if it's out of our, for example, if you mention IRCP or your PR application, those is not something we provide detailed response in writing.  I can discuss with you as a friend or as a professional outside of school, but the thing is not something we will answer.  I mean it just tell me because I thought like the one thing is you know I know like you  said you actually do all this immigration stuff too, the Cal10 CPA immigration so I  thought because I just want Amanda to when I recap it I know it take a lot of time for  me to think about all this but I just want to make sure that because I don't know if  from your team or just from us?  Just keep your relax on your back.  I just say that like a lot of the work you put into the app  or like it's something that like you create all this,  I would say that a little bit of stress for yourself  and also on us, but sometimes not necessary  because we do have a lot of audience faces.  No science would do that.  It's just no offense. I'm just saying that.  It's okay. Gary, I'm...  Hey, we are businessmen. It's okay if you throw me things. And I'll listen.  Gary, I just wanna... You just tell Amanda that maybe  it's just my style. Just when say something. Or when do  things, just telling me, like, okay, this is actually... Make sure that  it's actually she assess this and it's actually coming from your team because  I don't know like because I only know you I don't know  I think that's a great way that you communicate to me.  Because maybe I'm always a little bit different from a lot of people.  It's just my way of doing business.  Yes, yes, yes. But I just wanted to throw this, I guess, at the different way in Canada.  In Canada, we want to be multicultural. We accept different communication styles.  But when we handle this type of sensitive tax matters, we need our clients to follow our way.  Yeah, I definitely, but just tell them that the one thing, I also have a lot of clients, I work with clients, different clients, they have a different way of communication, not everyone is the same. So for sure, we are working together.  I'm for sure, you know, like the way you call me like this, you're not treating me like every client, right?  So we call, you're telling me this, and you're actually taking into consideration that I have a little more concern than you call,  which is a great way for you to do business, and that's exactly what I'm going to do, too.  It's just like sometimes, like, I would do, like, because if Amanda, like, if she just say things, like,  in a way that it just, you know, it's not emotional, but for me, it triggers me.  like oh she don't know that is that just come from me  yeah and actually all the data information  like one information out of like a  which is not helpful when we are really busy  yeah um i also want to like  emphasize one point is like usually in similar case  for clients like this we only give them like 30 minutes call  like because you're referred by a friend  like we actually give you a lot of interest conference  But I still understand you have a lot of passion in concerns, but I need to be a bit more straightforward about that.  But your concerns is like I understand your ultimate goals and your concerns.  You don't need to think about that too much right now.  Gary, if you said so, I would love to.  I just want to know, like, okay, Gary and the team already concede all information.  That's what I just want Amanda to say.  And if that's the case, then I'm fine.  I don't have to...  What did you say?  I'm saying it's like, because you said that right now,  I already take everything into consideration,  and our team too.  Because Amanda, when she answers and asks the question,  I'm scared because I don't know whether it's from your team  or it's from you or it's just from her.  I don't know her, you know.  Yeah, I see.  You just overanalyze.  Yeah, so...  for this type of discussion that we we  Gary, if you deal with me, because later I also want to need your help on the cooperation stuff.  If we work a long time, I like this man. I'm the kind of guy that I'm not getting offensive very easily.  I want you to throw at me whatever you feel like I'm not doing the right thing.  A lot of clients come to us because they like us being honest.  Just be honest. That's why I love to work with Hong Kong people.  right you guys are this and then I don't so I do something that is out of line  you say hey it's a little out of line oh I'll listen but I would love to hear and  I would love to hear from you because I I know like because I only know you  right now I don't know Amanda if like you and she'll hang Amanda I don't know  like what a coordinator to be honest I don't know what created  a lot of the time we like i need to be honest with you like like your email uh has a lot of  information which is not like usually we expect from clients and then um did have too much  information so no offense it's just it's just uh we want to make sure our client expectation  is met at the same time we need to connect our expectation sometimes we work with a lot of the  doctors for example they over analyze a lot and it looks like like an example for us or make it  like a research paper and then we would directly tell them no like please stop like we are trying  to get the text for the solve we are not trying to have uh hey i'm gary gary i'm a i'm a tech  guy man i'm a tech guy okay and you know tech guy can be very detail-oriented and you know it  and i'm also a businessman like you so uh but yes you tell me hey say i we got it i got it hey  i trust you i i trust you that's why i i signed with you right  we will give you another discussion we will have another discussion when we finish  everything and before we submitted to this yeah that would be great yes  It's a standard procedure. We wouldn't submit everything without getting your approval.  So don't worry about it. We just need some time to review and process it.  Also, is there anything now you cannot answer on the checklist or whatever?  Oh, my wife actually uploads everything. I also told Amanda too actually.  She only uploads to the Google Drive so that it's easy for us to keep that inside.  and then there are a few questions you have to do that my wife already is still up so so amanda  yeah i would say that it's because like you are very proactive and intelligent in a way that  it's very different uh 99 percent of our clients they know nothing and they need specific  guide you on everything and they need us to ask this  this specific question like we we understand you're being very cool at  your home everything and then and then we appreciate that and we will  we will try to like break out um how we can like uh do this better  together so that's why i need to get ready to call this  calm yourself down amanda tell me i cannot come  because i don't know whether it's gary talking  in way things also reviewed by us.  So because this type of advisory is located on thousand,  we had to leave the company  or that they have like over a billion dollars.  So yeah, we would like,  yeah, we would protect our own business.  Yeah, please protect me, Gary.  I really need your expertise right here. I just want you to notice this out case, please.  And, and, and...  It's actually, she is kind of, you know...  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.",

Just like, I would say it again, like relax and then let us do the work and then we will have the chance to discuss everything in detail until the point that you feel confident and then we will send the response. Yeah, because now, a lot of the questions, I would say they are paraphrased in different ways, but they are just asking the same thing. We actually took the both of them in the call that we did just last week. and it's okay because the knowledge part is different way that's why you come to us. I would say that, it's not to take it as an offense, but please understand that unfortunately you have really limited time and knowledge and that's why it's the time to try to understand our perspective and why we need to do this. It's not because we want to just take time and not answer your question or whatever. Because a lot of the time, like for example, I give you a really good example. For example, you cause the outrage, or you mention a whole bunch of others like, oh, I'm not restful, and blah, blah. And all that should be completely removed from your mind because this is just overanalyzed and being really paranoid, and this will not help the case. Yes, because our ultimate goal is like we are working with you to be friends with you and work out your back interest. So we know what is the good. Sometimes in your mind you need to get rid of those very first yes. Yeah. May I say something? Yes. So thank you for calling and trying to clarify it. I agree. I agree. You know, Gary, there's one thing, Gary. So when Amanda asked the question differently, it wouldn't trigger me. I just, you know, because I went after, I paid you guys, I did a lot of studies, okay? And I know you guys are one of the top. and that's why I decided to go with you guys, with you specifically, to be honest, because I talk to you, so I trust you. So, like, when Amanda asked me questions where the way she talked, you know, I'm a detail auditor guy. Come on, I'm a fucking founder, right? I'm a founder. I have businesses. I'm at this age, you know, I've been experiencing a lot of stuff. And it's not... It's okay, all the things. I'm not sure. I'm sure that I have unlimited... I have limited knowledge intact. that's why i'm here with you right because you know all this and i love to work with you",
